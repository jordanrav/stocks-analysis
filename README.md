# Stocks Analysis
## Overview

the purpose of this analysis is to look at different green energy stocks from multiple years and see stocks total daily volume and the return of investment for each stock

## Results and Images

### Results
based on the images below, using the refactored code made the process of finding the total daily volume and return of investment of stocks on a certain year way faster than the original code did. and for the results, the original and refactored code had the same exact results.

## Summary

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code
for advantages, refactoring code made the speed of processing the stocks way faster than the original code which is beneficial if you have thousands of stocks that you have to analyze. The disadvantage of refactoring code is that refactoring it can be harder for a coder to write and lead to a higher probability that you have an error in your code

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA Script
As you can see from the images section above the time to process the 2018 stocks was extremely faster once the code was refactored but the cons were that in the process of refractoring the code, i had an error that took me a lot of time to fix (the problem was it wouldnt get the whole total daily volume and I fixed it by adding an if statement that would make sure it added the missing daily volume.)
